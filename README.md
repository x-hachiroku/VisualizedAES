This is a implementation of the AES in pure Python, which allows you to manipulate the detaled
operations. The project aims to solve the following problems and provide a clear visualization
of the AES algorithm:

* What's the different with ECB, CBC, and CTR?
* What if a special key/input/IV is used, e.g. all zeros or all ones?
* What's the result after each round of encryption/decryption?
* What if substitution or permutation is disabled?
* What happens when decrypting a plaintext or encrypting a ciphertext again, or encrypt with one
  mode/key and decrypt with another mode/key?
